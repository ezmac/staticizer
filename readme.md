This is a project to learn some different javascript.  I'd like to convert pages into static site generators like jekyll.  Step one to writing a general solution to that is to write something that can quickly chunk out a site to files.

currently, it's usable by somenone who knows javascript, though it's not the friendliest.  
Still need to unhardcode things and actually respect the options object given in the page constructor.
